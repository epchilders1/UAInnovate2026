# **Project Sentinel: Intelligent Resource Management & Analytics**

## **Executive Summary**

Project Sentinel is a full-stack engineering challenge designed to test the integration of modern web technologies, predictive analytics, and secure data orchestration. Participants are tasked with building a centralized Command and Control (C2) dashboard to manage global resource distribution during a simulated multi-sector crisis.

## **🎯 Project Objectives**

The objective is to develop a robust, end-to-end system capable of the following:

1. **Analytical Visualization:** Transform high-velocity historical data into actionable insights via interactive dashboards.  
2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to ingest and structure unstructured field intelligence.  
3. **Predictive Modeling:** Implement Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to forecast resource depletion and supply chain failures.  
4. **Data Privacy & Security:** Engineer a secure middleware layer to anonymize Sensitive Personal Information (SPI/PII) before external processing.

## **📦 Provided Dataset (Crisis Scenario: "The Avengers Initiative")**

To ground the technical challenge, the provided datasets utilize a fictional crisis scenario involving the "Avengers" task force.

* historical\_avengers\_data.csv: 10,000 observations of time-series resource stock levels across various global sectors (e.g., Wakanda, New Asgard).  
* field\_intel\_reports.json: 200 unstructured intelligence reports containing sensitive hero identities and contact information.

## **🏗️ Technical Specifications**

* **Frontend:** A responsive, high-fidelity UI (React, Vue, or Next.js) focusing on data density and user experience.  
* **Backend:** A scalable API service (Node.js, Python, Go) managing business logic and external service orchestration.  
* **Database:** A persistent storage solution (Relational or Document-based) for historical logs and processed intelligence.  
* **Security Protocol:** Implementation of a "Privacy-by-Design" middleware to redact PII (Names, Phone Numbers) from unstructured text before it is transmitted to third-party LLM APIs.

## **🏆 Performance Benchmarks**

* **Data Integrity:** Seamless synchronization between the frontend state and backend database.  
* **Algorithmic Accuracy:** Precision and reliability of the ML-driven forecasting models.  
* **Architectural Sophistication:** Modular code structure, error handling, and secure API design.

*Professionalism, security, and system stability are the primary evaluation metrics for this challenge.*
